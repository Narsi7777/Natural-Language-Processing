Review
I absolutely loved the plot and the acting.
The movie was too long and boring.
Great soundtrack and cinematography.
Terrible direction and weak storyline.
A must-watch for anyone who enjoys thrillers.
The dialogue delivery was top-notch.
Visual effects were stunning and realistic.
Story lacked depth and emotional connection.
Characters were poorly developed.
Ending was unexpected and brilliantly executed.
An emotional journey with relatable characters.
Too predictable and lacked originality.
Exceptional performance by the lead actress.
The pacing was slow and uneven.
Brilliantly written and executed screenplay.
Missed opportunities to explore side plots.
The setting and costumes were fantastic.
The comedy fell flat in most scenes.
It was visually pleasing but empty in content.
Plot twists were overused and confusing.
One of the best films in recent years.
Sound design was immersive and impactful.
Couldnâ€™t keep me engaged after the first half.
Supporting actors did a phenomenal job.
Would not recommend it to serious movie lovers.
